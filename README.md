## About the theme

This theme is a modified version of [Matt Button's](https://www.mattbutton.com) Hugo Silhoutte theme to remove some hard-coded modifications I did not like.

This is not really intended for public re-use, but you're welcome to copy this and run off with it, but starting from Matt's git might be cleaner.

## Usage

If you really want to use this version, and not Matt's original, create a new Hugo site by typing

```
  $ hugo new site <SITENAME>
```

Then clone this repository:

```
  $ cd <SITENAME>/themes
  $ git clone https://github.com/mattbutton/silhouette-hugo.git
```

Now take a look at the exampleSite folder and you're ready to go!
